## About

[FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) is a proxy server to bypass Cloudflare protection. It starts a proxy server that waits for user requests in an idle state using few resources. When a request arrives, it uses Puppeteer with the stealth plugin to create a headless browser (Firefox) that solves Cloudflare challenges.

Key features:
- Bypasses Cloudflare protection automatically
- Headless browser automation with Firefox
- RESTful API for integration with other tools
- Cookie extraction for subsequent requests
- Support for various Cloudflare challenge types

**Note**: Web browsers consume significant memory. Avoid making many concurrent requests on systems with limited RAM.

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other add-on.
