## About

Self-hosted photo and video backup solution directly from your mobile phone with OpenVINO hardware acceleration support. This is the OpenVINO-enabled variant of Immich that provides hardware acceleration for machine learning tasks using Intel GPUs and CPUs.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/imagegenius/docker-immich) from imagegenius with OpenVINO support enabled for enhanced performance on Intel hardware.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Intel Hardware**: Compatible Intel CPU or Intel integrated/discrete GPU
- **OpenVINO Support**: Intel hardware with OpenVINO toolkit compatibility
- **Architecture**: AMD64 only (OpenVINO support optimized for Intel x86-64 architectures)
- **Intel GPU Drivers**: Intel GPU drivers properly installed on the host system (for Intel GPU acceleration)

## Configuration

Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:8080`. PostgreSQL can be either internal or external.

### Mounting Drives

This addon supports mounting both local drives and remote SMB shares:

- **Local drives**: See [Mounting Local Drives in Addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Mounting-Local-Drives-in-Addons)
- **Remote shares**: See [Mounting Remote Shares in Addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Mounting-remote-shares-in-Addons)

### Custom Scripts and Environment Variables

This addon supports custom scripts and environment variables through the `addon_config` mapping:

- **Custom scripts**: See [Running Custom Scripts in Addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Running-custom-scripts-in-Addons)
- **Environment variables**: See [Add Environment Variables to your Addon](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Add-Environment-variables-to-your-Addon)

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

**Prerequisites:**
- Intel CPU or Intel GPU for OpenVINO acceleration
- AMD64 architecture (ARM not supported)
- Intel GPU drivers installed (if using Intel GPU acceleration)

**Steps:**
1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Carefully configure the add-on to your preferences, see the official documentation for for that.

**Database Setup:**
Beware that you need to install a separate postgres addon to be able to connect the database. You can install the postgres addon already in my repository.
Beware to change the password BEFORE starting it ; it won't change afterwards
