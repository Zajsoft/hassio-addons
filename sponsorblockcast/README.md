## About

CastSponsorSkip is a Go program that skips sponsored YouTube content and skippable ads on all local Chromecasts, using the SponsorBlock API. It was inspired by CastBlock but written from scratch to avoid some of its pitfalls (see Differences from CastBlock).

This app is developed by @gabe565 in the [CastSponsorSkip repository](https://github.com/gabe565/CastSponsorSkip).

Feedback from @diamant-x :
> Special attention that it only works when casting to a chromecast a youtube video. It mostly removes manual interaction, can't magically skip ads when they are forced to be viewed.
> Also, it doesn't seem to work when playing on an android tv through native youtube app, which would be a great addition, or on a smartphone.

## Configuration

This addon has no web interface - all configuration is done through addon options.
The addon automatically discovers local Chromecast devices and monitors YouTube playback to skip sponsored content.

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `CSS_CATEGORIES` | str | `sponsor, intro, outro, selfpromo` | SponsorBlock categories to skip (comma-separated) |
| `CSS_DISCOVER_INTERVAL` | str | `5m` | Interval to restart the DNS discovery client |
| `CSS_DEVICES` | str | `[]` | Comma-separated list of device addresses; disables discovery |
| `CSS_MUTE_ADS` | bool | `true` | Mutes the device while an ad is playing |
| `CSS_PAUSED_INTERVAL` | str | `1m` | Poll interval when the Cast device is paused |
| `CSS_PLAYING_INTERVAL` | str | `500ms` | Poll interval when the Cast device is playing |
| `CSS_SKIP_SPONSORS` | bool | `true` | Toggle SponsorBlock segment skipping; if disabled only YouTube ads are skipped |
| `CSS_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | str | `` | YouTube API key for fallback video identification |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
CSS_CATEGORIES: "sponsor, intro, outro, selfpromo, interaction"
CSS_MUTE_ADS: false
CSS_PAUSED_INTERVAL: "30s"
CSS_PLAYING_INTERVAL: "500ms"
